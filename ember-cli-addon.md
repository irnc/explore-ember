## Installation

Which method is preferred?

* `ember install ...`
  * saves fixed npm dependency, e.g. `0.4.0`
  * see https://github.com/csantero/ember-sinon
* `npm install --save-dev ...` & `ember generate ...`
  * saves caret range npm dependency, e.g. `^0.4.0`
  * see https://github.com/san650/ember-cli-page-object for `npm install` case
  * see * see https://github.com/kiwiupover/ember-cli-spinjs for `ember generate` as a second step
